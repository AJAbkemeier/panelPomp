Description: Tools for working with longitudinal/panel POMPs, i.e., with
    Partially Observed Markov Processes (AKA state-space models, stochastic
    dynamical systems) involving multiple, independent units (or individuals) for
    each of which (potentially multivariate) time series data is available. The
    basic idea driving 'ppomp' is to apply to a collection of units (or individuals)
    some of the 'pomp' package facilities for implementing POMP models, simulating
    them, and fitting them to time series data. Regarding fitting, only the
    iterated filtering (mif2) algorithm has currently been extended to the 'ppomp'
    longitudinal/panel setting. (Alpha release version.)
