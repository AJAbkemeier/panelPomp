## Governance of **panelPomp**

**panelPomp** is organized as a collaborative project, directed by its core development team. Core developers are as follows:

| Name          | Start date | End date | Comments        |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Carles Breto  |  5/22/16   |          | founding member |
| Aaron King    |  5/22/16   |          | founding member |
| Ed Ionides    |  5/22/16   |          | founding member | 
| Jesse Wheeler |  5/30/23   |          |                 |

The maintainer was Carles Breto until 8/26/24, at which point Jesse Wheeler took that position.

We have a few rules, sufficient for a small and friendly project.

## Rules

1. Decisions are made by a majority vote of the core developers. A simple majority of votes in support of a decision (greater than half the number of members of core developers) is required for a decision to be passed.

4. The core development team votes to select a maintainer who is responsible for keeping an up-to-date version of panelPomp on CRAN.

5. All core developers can edit the source code without requiring approval from other core developers.  All core developers can incorporate edits proposed by other contributors. No developer should change the edit history, and therefore any change can be reversed if the core development team decides to do so.

6. New core developers are selected by a vote of the existing core developers.

7. Anyone who writes code included in panelPomp is a contributor. A core developer can also add someone to a list of contributors if they have contributed to the project in some other way such as writing open-source applications using panelPomp.
